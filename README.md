# Sentiport Controller

**Sentiport-controller** is an additional tools to manage report request on [**Sentiport**](https://github.com/yosiaazarya/sentiport). Minimum requester information could be gathered from **Sentiport** only, thus we need a controller app to store request information such as requester *Name, e-mail, Phone Number, Company* into database (in this case we use Google Sheet), and using approval system by Business Development team. Can be accessed through our landing page on [Algoritma page](https://algorit.ma/sentiport/). 

The **sentiport-controller** app also help **Sentiport** problem which was memory leak on the app. The memory leak caused some report request to be stucked and would not give any feedback to requester. With **sentiport-controller** app, we could automatically re-request missing information when the memory leak happen. **sentiport-controller** app continuously listen to Google Sheets (database) and calls **Sentiport** API-endpoint to trigger a report to be generated and sent to information based on information **sentiport-controller** app send to **Sentiport**. Using *gspread* to connect with Google Sheet API; *Pandas* and *Numpy* for data wrangling, and *request* for API calling.
